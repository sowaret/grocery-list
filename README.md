# Grocery List

The goal of this project is to create a tool for family or other household members to manage and collaborate on grocery lists. It is integrated with the Kroger API to see availability of products at stores, check sale prices, and display other product information.

Users can claim items to be picked up during a trip and keep each other updated on their progress using a shared, real-time checklist.
